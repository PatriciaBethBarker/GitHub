 A10: Git Branch & Merge

In this assignment weâ€™ll utilize our Git branching and merging skills while creating HTML pages on a topic of interest to you and others.  

Groups: Canvas has split the class into random groups of 3-4 students for this assignment.  You'll be creating a repo of your work to collaborate with others in your group, while they will be creating a repo to share with you.  You'll do work on your repo and the repos of at least on 2 others in your group.

How To Find People In Your Group: Go to the navigation bar on the left in Canvas and select People >> Groups.  Explore the Branch & Merge groups to find the names of those in your group.  You can find their Github ID's via the Gig Central Staging Area.

Create a Repo with an HTML Page: Create a public Git repo and add your group members as collaborators.  Create a single web page expecting it to be heavily edited by the others in your group and place it in your repo.  Find a topic that might be useful or interesting to you and others, for example:

    A single HTML Page of GitHub Commands (Cheat Sheet)
    A single HTML Page of musical artist albums you listen to while developing
    A single HTML Page of links to PHP or JavaScript resources, etc.

Branch: Once you have an initial HTML page in your repo, create a branch and do some more work on your HTML page.  Feel free to work on your new branch and make as many changes as you wish.  
Be sure not to merge your branch until others in your group have branched and changed the repo as well. 

Conflicts Wanted: In order to get the most out of this assignment, we want there to be merge conflicts.  Using a single file in the repo and allowing others to collaborate and create their own branches and merge allows us to practice our merge conflict skills in a low risk environment.

Conflict Resolution Scenarios: Since we're working on a single HTML page, when you view a merge conflict it will likely apply to data added by two or more developers on your page.  Some of the things you may wish to resolve include:

    Do you want to place items in a particular order?
    Do you need to remove duplicates?  
    Does the data added meet your style criteria?

You're in charge of the HTML file in your repo, as they are in theirs.  Be respectful of the work of others and if you need to identify why you made a change, create an issue in your repo to identify your reasoning, etc.  Contact the others as you work so they know you made a change so they can come back and review and merge.

Assignment Complete: Your assignment will be complete when you have:

Participated in editing and adding to the HTML file that is in the repo of at least 2 others in your group.
Resolved at least one merge conflict in your repo.
Once the above is completed, posted a link to your repo, and specifically to the Issues page where you identify the details of the merge conflict that you had to resolve and how you worked it out.
